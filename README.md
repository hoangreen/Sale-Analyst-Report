# 🏠 Sale-Analyst-Report
# 🚀 Overview:
This project focuses on customer and product data analysis to support business strategy. The Power BI report provides insights from two key perspectives:
1. RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
Evaluates customer behavior based on last purchase date, purchase frequency, and total spending.

Segments customers into groups like New Customers, At Risk, Champions, Loyal Customers for personalized engagement strategies.

Visualizes data by age, region, and customer segments to analyze trends.

2. Product Analysis
Identifies the top 5 best-selling products and bottom 5 lowest-selling products.

Assesses product performance based on revenue, profitability, and growth rate.

Forecasts revenue trends to optimize the product portfolio.

# 🎯 Project Objective:
✅ Optimize marketing strategies & customer retention

- Detect At Risk customers and implement targeted retention campaigns.

- Develop personalized promotions for loyal and high-value customers (Loyal, Champions).

✅ Improve sales performance & optimize product portfolio

- Identify best-selling products to focus marketing efforts.

- Discontinue or improve low-performing products.

- Forecast revenue trends to enhance inventory management.

✅ Support data-driven decision making

- Provide detailed reports for more accurate business decisions.

- Track revenue changes over time to evaluate strategy effectiveness.

# 🚀 I Customer-Segmentation:
Companies need to identify target audiences for their product offerings, they target segments rather than a whole market to get better payoffs. Precision improves marketing with personalized messages, better conversions, lower costs, and higher ROI.

RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that evaluates customer behavior based on three key factors:

Recency (how recently a customer made a purchase)

Frequency (how often a customer makes purchases)

Monetary Value (the total amount a customer has spent).

1️⃣ New Customers (5.8K Customers)

📌 Meaning: This group consists of new customers who have just made their first purchase.

📊 Data Analysis:

- Largest segment among all groups (5.8K customers).

- Low purchase frequency as they have just started buying.

- No loyalty yet due to limited purchasing history.

- High potential to become loyal customers if provided with the right care strategy.

📈 Strategic Approach:

✅ Create a positive experience:

- Send a welcome email with a discount for the next purchase.

- Provide product/service guides to increase the chances of repeat purchases.

✅ Guide customers toward future purchases:

- Recommend related products or upsell/cross-sell opportunities.

- Implement a loyalty program to encourage repeat purchases.

✅ Monitor and analyze customer behavior:

- Identify which customers are likely to convert into Loyal Customers.

- Track the repeat purchase rate of new customers to adjust engagement strategies.

2️⃣ At Risk Customers (4.2K Customers)

📌 Meaning: This group consists of customers who have previously made purchases but have not returned for a long time.

📊 Data Analysis:

- A relatively large group (4.2K customers) that requires attention to prevent revenue loss.

- Long periods of inactivity, indicating a risk of customer churn.

- Could be influenced by competitors or dissatisfaction with products/services.

📈 Strategic Approach:

✅ Reactivation campaigns:

- Send reminder emails/SMS with special promotions.

- Offer personalized discounts based on past purchase history.

✅ Identify reasons for inactivity:

- Collect customer feedback on product/service experience.

- Assess factors such as pricing, product quality, or after-sales service.

✅ Create incentives for returning customers:

- Implement a loyalty program with bonus points for returning purchases.

- Share information about new products or attractive feature updates.

To understand our segments better, I will look at their characteristics in terms of age group, region_segment, to understand which of these characteristics are dominant among segments.

# What is the age distribution of our target segments?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/302fd49a-107d-42fc-b775-f3188d4704db)

- The 45 - <65 age group has both a high number of New Customers and At Risk customers, requiring a strong focus on customer retention.
- The 30 - <45 age group has great potential to create loyal customers, making it essential to invest in a loyalty program.
- The 65++ age group has a lower number of customers but still requires a tailored strategy to maximize customer value.

🚀 Actionable Steps
- Retain new customers through special offers, post-purchase care, and after-sales policies.

- Reduce At Risk customers with re-engagement programs and discounts for their next purchase.

- Increase the number of loyal customers by implementing a loyalty program and personalizing offers based on purchasing behavior.
